# NeuralNetwork-Hardware-Acceleration

## Introduction
This project focuses on developing, optimizing, and accelerating a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The aim is to achieve high accuracy during training and significantly improve inference throughput using FPGA acceleration.

### Step 1: Train a CNN for CIFAR-10 Classification
#### Objective
Design and train a CNN capable of classifying the CIFAR-10 dataset.

### Step2: Accelerate inference of the neural network on the FPGA

Use the FPGA fabric of the KRIA KV260 board to accelerate the inference of the trained CNN, maximizing throughput without significant accuracy loss.
